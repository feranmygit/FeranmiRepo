# [Greeting] Welcome, Master Oluwaferanmi Oladunjoye.

## [1.0] Based on Javascript Objects and Arrays
Objects and Arrays are fundamental data structures in JavaScript

 ### [1.1] Objects

 I noted;
 1. A collection of key-value pairs
 2. I noted Keys are strings, and Values can be any type as well as functions
 3. Defined by using curly brackects {} or object constructor
 4. properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation
 5. Methods can added to objects using fuctions
 6. Can be nested, allowing for complex data structures

  ### [1.2] Arrays
 
 I noted;
 1. A collection of values of any type
 2. Defined using square brackets [] or array constructor
 3. Elements can be accessed using index (number values)
 4. Arrays have built-in methods for manipulation (e.g. push, pop, sort)
 5. Can be nested, allowing for multi-dimensional arrays

 ## [2.0] Based on JavaScript if, else, and else if
They work as a conditional statements which are essential for decision-making in JavaScript

 ### [2.1] if Statement
 1. Syntax: if (condition){code to execute}
 2. Executes code if the condition is true 
 3. Condition is a boolean expression

 ### [2.2] else if Statement
 1. Syntax: if (condition){code to execute}
 2. Executes code if the previous conditions are false and the current condition is true
 3. Can be chained multiple times 

 ### [2.3] else Statement
 1. Syntax: if (condition){code to execute}
 2. Executes code if the previous conditions are false

 ### [2.4] Best practices 
 1. Keep conditions simple and clear
 2. Use curly braces for code blocks
 3. Use strict equality operators (===, !==) instead of loose equality operators (==, !=)

 ### [0.0] Resources
 1. W3Schools
 2. MDN Web Docs
